## What to do if your project doesn't have a folder yet

- Open a github issue talking about your project
- Wait to get write access to the repo
- Create a folder for your project with it's name
- Create a README for your project, look at what others are doing but feel free to make your own thing

## How should I post updates

- Create a branch for your update
- Create a file that's using [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) eg `YYY-MM-DD.md`
- Write your updates in whatever format you want
- Submit a PR to the `master` branch
- Merge your own PR (This just gives us a paper trail and send updates to people following the repo)

## Suggestions on what to include in README

- Name of project
- Description
- Links to modules
- Links to people working on the project
- Links to communication channels (eg. #dat on IRC)
