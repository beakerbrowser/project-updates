## What to do if your project doesn't have a folder yet

- Open a github issue talking about your project
- Wait to get write access to the repo
- Copy the folder named `project-template` and rename it with your project's name
- Change the `README.md` therein to better reflect your project, look at what others are doing but feel free to make it your own thing

## How to post updates

- Create a branch for your update
- Create a new markdown file named using [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) eg `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Structure your post however you want with markdown
- Submit a PR to the `master` branch
- Merge your own PR (This just gives us a paper trail and send updates to people following the repo)

## Suggestions on what to include in README

- Name of project
- Description
- Links to modules
- Links to people working on the project
- Links to communication channels (eg. #dat on IRC)
